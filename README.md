Design/UX Task - Critique the UX/UI of a sample sales page


## 🧐 Additional Website Evaluation

> While the original task did not explicitly request website evaluations, I took the initiative to review the design and usability of the following sites. This additional analysis is intended to highlight areas for improvement and demonstrate a deeper level of engagement.

### ▶ Hidden or weak Contact button (CTA)

❌ **Problem:**  
A design firm’s site must make it easy to be reached. If the “Contact Us” or “Let’s Talk” link is buried in a menu, many visitors can miss it.

✅ **Solution:**  
Add a prominent “Contact” button in the header (e.g., a brightly colored “Let’s Talk” button) and/or fix a small call-to-action bar on scroll. The button should be large enough and placed in a high-visibility spot so desktop users immediately see how to inquire.

### ▶ Missing HTTPS (Security & Trust Issue)

❌ **Problem:**  
The site uses plain HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is flagged by browsers as Not Secure. This breaks user trust, especially for a creative or tech brand.

✅ **Solution:**  
Install an SSL certificate and redirect all traffic to HTTPS. This is free and easy. It is essential for credibility and is a basic expectation for any modern website.

### ▶ Button Clickable Area Misalignment

❌ **Problem:**  
The button on the project page ([kabinet-brewery](http://eklektika.rs/web/view/kabinet-brewery)) has a broken interactive zone — the clickable area extends beyond the visible button boundaries. Additionally, the cursor changes to a pointer when hovering outside the actual button, leading to a misleading user experience.

✅ **Solution:**  
Review and clean up the button’s CSS. Make sure the interactive area matches the visible boundaries, and align the clickable region correctly with the button’s shape.

### ▶ Overused CTAs

❌ **Problem:**  
The website has multiple CTAs scattered across the page, which can cause decision fatigue.

✅ **Solution:**  
Reduce to one or two prominent CTAs (e.g., one in the hero and one at the end) and use clear, inviting labels like “Start Free Trial.” Placing a single, standout button above the fold helps users know exactly what to do next.

### ▶ Inconsistent Layout Between Languages

❌ **Problem:**  
The English and German versions of the DigiBiz24 website have significantly different layouts, content hierarchy, and design emphasis, breaking international UX best practices for multilingual sites.

✅ **Solution:**  
Use a consistent global template across language versions to maintain brand coherence, improve user experience, and avoid confusion when switching pages.

### ▶ Untranslated German Version

❌ **Problem:**  
The German version of the DigiBiz24 site contains multiple sections and phrases still written in English (e.g., "Affiliate Area," "Pages, Funnels and Member Areas"), which breaks linguistic consistency and can confuse native German users. This, combined with major layout differences from the English version, creates a disjointed and unprofessional multilingual experience.

✅ **Solution:**  
Ensure full translation of all visible text on the German site and unify visual structure across languages using a shared layout template. This improves credibility, supports localization best practices, and enhances trust with international users.
